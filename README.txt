As a part of my MSIM coursework(Interactive Information Visualization), I was told to 
Step 1. Pick a domain that i am interested in.

Step 2. Pose an initial question that I would like to answer.
For example: Is there a relationship between melting point and atomic number? Are the brightness and color of stars correlated? Are there different patterns of nucleotides in different regions in human DNA?

Step 3. Assess the fitness of the data for answering my question.
Inspect the data--it is invariably helpful to first look at the raw values. Does the data seem appropriate for answering your question? If not, I may need to start the process over. If so, does the data need to be reformatted or cleaned prior to analysis? Perform any steps necessary to get the data into shape prior to visual analysis.

I iterated through these steps a few times. It was challenging to find interesting questions and a dataset that has the information that I need to answer those questions. Hence I selected the superhero dataset to perform this exploratory data analysis.

The pdf file includes the visualizations and the process of my exploration.
